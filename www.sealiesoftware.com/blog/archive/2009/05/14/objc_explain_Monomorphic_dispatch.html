	Polymorphic dispatch means a single call site could branch to one
	of several different implementations. C function calls are not
	polymorphic; Objective-C methods and C++ virtual methods are
	polymorphic. 
      </p>
      <p>
	The monomorphic dispatch optimization is used when a call site
	could call different implementations in principle, but can only 
	ever call one particular implementation in reality. Then the
	optimizer can eliminate the polymorphic dispatcher's overhead and
	jump directly to the right place or even inline the callee
	locally. This is a classic 
	optimization for dynamic-compiled runtimes from Smalltalk to Java
	and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
	There are some complications. First is dynamically-loaded code
	like shared libraries or eval() operations. If your new code
	provides a second implementation of a call that was previously
	monomorphic, you need to be able to undo the previous optimization
	on the fly and recompile it or fall back to an interpreter. Any
	dynamic compiler worth the name can do this nowadays.
      </p>
      <p>
	Second, the area to search for additional implementations depends
	on the type-strictness of your language. If the compile-time type
	of the receiver rigidly defines the allowed runtime types, then
	the implementation need only be unique within that part of the
	hierarchy for the optimization to work. <code>Window.title</code>
	and <code>Employee.title</code> wouldn't interfere with each other
	at a strictly-typed call site whose receiver is of type
	<code>Employee</code> (or a subclass thereof). 
      </p>
      <p>
	How does Objective-C fit in here? In general, it doesn't. The
	monomorphic optimization is hard to apply to Objective-C. The two
	problems above loom large because of the language's definition,
	even if it suddenly acquired a runtime recompiler tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
	Objective-C's call sites are not type-strict. The code may say the
	receiver is of some type, but at runtime it could actually be a
	Distributed Objects proxy or a unit test mock or a scripting
	bridge shim. You'd have to look at all classes to decide if a 
	selector has multiple implementations, instead of searching only a
	subtree of the class hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
	Even worse, there are zero selectors that have only a single
	implementation. They all have at least two: the one that exists in 
	some class, and the one from every other class that calls
	-forwardInvocation:. You can never jump directly to any 
	implementation, because if your receiver object is of the wrong
	type then you need to call the forwarding machinery instead. And
	checking the receiver's type quickly eats any optimization profit;
	you can only make a handful of checks before your cost is the
	same as <code>objc_msgSend()</code>. 
      </p>
      <p>
	There are some important cases where monomorphic dispatch would
	still work in Objective-C. The container classes in particular
	have only one or two real implementations, so a receiver type
	check could be fast enough. And in other places you can make a single
	relatively expensive type check but then re-use the result many
	times, such as a series of <code>[self ...]</code> calls. The
	tricky part is identifying which selectors and call sites would
	optimize well, without taking too much time or memory to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
	The monomorphic dispatch optimization will be present in some
	future dynamic-recompiling Objective-C runtime, but it won't work
	as well as it does in other less-dynamic languages.
      </p>
