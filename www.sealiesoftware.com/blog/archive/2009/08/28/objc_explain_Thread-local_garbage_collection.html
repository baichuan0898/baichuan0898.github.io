	Mac OS X Snow Leopard introduces thread-local collection, a big
	enhancement to the Objective-C garbage collector. Thread-local
	collection is a more efficient way to reclaim much of the
	garbage in most programs. It also scales better to more threads
	and more cores than the other algorithms used by the Objective-C
	GC.
      </p>
      <h4>A brief history of garbage collection</h4>
      <p>
	The simplest algorithm used by the Objective-C GC is <b>full
	collection</b>. The GC scans all live objects in the entire heap, 
	discovers (approximately) all dead objects, and reclaims
	them. This is slow, especially if you have a large
	population of not-dead objects, but does find all possible
	garbage. Historically this is mostly 1960-era technology, except
	for the machinery that allows other threads to run mostly
	unhindered while the scan completes. 
      </p>
      <p>
	The second algorithm used by the Objective-C GC is <b>generational
	collection</b>. This takes advantage of the <i>generational
	hypothesis</i>: most objects die young. The heap is divided into
	at least two generations: new objects and old objects. After
	allocating some amount of new objects, the collector runs a
	generational collection. First, it scans only the "new" objects
	and any "old" objects into which a pointer to a "new" object was
	stored. Then the now-dead "new" objects are reclaimed, and the
	surviving "new" objects are aged, moving them to the next 
	generation. The advantage of generational GC is that it collects
	lots of garbage (most objects die young) with much less work (it
	does not need to scan most of the "old" objects). Full collections
	are still needed to reclaim objects that survive infancy and die
	later, but run less often. Generational collection is 1980-era
	technology. 
      </p> 
      <h4>Thread-local collection</h4>
      <p>
	The third algorithm is the new <b>thread-local collection</b>. TLC
	is similar to generational collection: it scans and reclaims a
	subset of objects, trying to get lots of bang for the collector's
	buck. The <i>thread-local</i> hypothesis: most objects die without
	being reachable by any other thread. Newly-allocated objects are
	marked thread-local to the allocating thread. If a thread-local
	object becomes accessible to another thread (for example, a
	pointer to it is written into a global variable), then it has
	"escaped" and is moved
	out of the thread-local set. In a thread-local collection, a
	thread scans its own stack and its set of thread-local objects, and
	reclaims the dead objects.
      </p>
      <p>
	The advantage of thread-local collection is that it requires no
	synchronization with other threads. Normally, a thread performing
	GC work needs to coordinate with the other threads. For example,
	the other threads change a pointer variable after the GC thread
	has looked at it, or start pointing to an object that the GC
	thread thinks is dead. Thread-local collection avoids these
	complications. The thread-local objects are
	by definition reachable only by one thread. The other threads
	have no way acquire a pointer to any of those objects, or change 
	pointer
	values inside them. A thread performing thread-local collection
	can work quickly on its own, without interference from other threads.
      </p>
      <p>
	Having each thread "clean up after itself" reduces 
	bottlenecks in the collector that will only get worse as threads
	and cores increase. It's trivial to run thread-local
	collections on multiple threads simultaneously. And it's very fast
	because the only memory to scan is the thread's own stack and its 
	surviving thread-local objects. The pause time for a thread during
	generational or full GC is almost as big as the pause time for
	that thread to run a thread-local collection - but TLC can then
	immediately reclaim some garbage, 
	whereas the other algorithms need to do much more work and
	coordinate with all of the other threads 
	before they can actually reclaim anything.
      </p>
      <h4>How you can help</h4>
      <p>
	Thread-local collection works best when objects remain unreachable
	to other threads. In the Objective-C collector, this means
	avoiding CFRetain() of temporary objects when possible. A
	CFRetained pointer could go anywhere behind the collector's back,
	bypassing the write barrier that the collector uses to keep track
	of escaping objects. (This is one place that Snow Leopard leaves
	room for improvement: the system frameworks often allocate objects
	with a CF retain count of one and immediately release them, making
	them ineligible for thread-local collection.) Other ways for an
	object to escape thread-local collection include storing a pointer
	into a global variable; storing a pointer into some other object
	that itself is not thread-local; and making a weak reference or
	associated reference to the object.
      </p>
      <p>
	If your thread has just created and discarded a lot of temporary
	objects, you can give the collector a hint that now might be a
	good time to run. <code>-[NSGarbageCollector
	collectIfNeeded]</code> and <code>-[NSAutoreleasePool
	drain]</code> are two such hints. These may run a thread-local
	collection first, and may follow up with generational or full
	collection.
