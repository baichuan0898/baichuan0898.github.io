	Mac OS X Snow Leopard cuts in half the launch-time overhead of
	starting the Objective-C runtime, and simultaneously saves a few
	hundred KB of memory per app. This comes for free to every app,
	courtesy of one of the few pieces of Mac OS X that lives below
	even the Objective-C runtime: dyld.
      </p>
<h4>dyld and the shared cache</h4>
      <p>
	dyld is the dynamic loader and linker. When your process starts,
	dyld loads your executable and its shared libraries into memory,
	links the cross-library C function and variable references
	together, and starts execution on its way towards
	<code>main()</code>. 
      </p>
      <p>
	In theory a shared library could be different every time your
	program is run. In practice, you get the same version of
	the shared libraries almost every time you run, and so does every
	other process on the system. The system takes advantage of this by
	building the dyld shared cache. The shared cache contains a copy
	of many system libraries, with most of dyld's linking and loading
	work done in advance. Every process can then share that shared
	cache, saving memory and launch time. 
      </p>
      <p>
	(Incidentally, the shared cache beats the pants off the pre-Leopard
	prebinding system that was supposed to achieve the same
	optimizations. Remember the post-install "Optimizing System
	Performance" step that often took longer than the install itself?
	That was prebinding being updated. Rebuilding the shared cache is 
	so blazingly fast that the installer doesn't bother to report it
	anymore.) 
      </p>
      <h4>Objective-C selector uniquing</h4>
      <p>
	Leopard's dyld shared cache is great for C code, but it didn't do
	anything to help Objective-C's startup overhead. The single
	biggest launch cost for Objective-C is selector uniquing. The app
	and every shared library contain their own copies of selector
	names like "alloc" and "init". The runtime needs to choose a
	single canonical SEL pointer value for each selector name, and
	then update the metadata for every call site and method list to 
	use the blessed unique value. This means building a big hash table
	(memory), calling <code>strcmp()</code> a lot (time), and
	modifying copy-on-write metadata (more memory). 
      </p>
      <p>
	There are tens of thousands of unique selectors present in a
	typical process. If you run <code>`strings
	/usr/lib/libobjc.dylib`</code> on Leopard you can see the
	thirty-thousand-line 
	<a
	href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/objc4/objc4-371/runtime/objc-sel-table.h">built-in
	selector table</a> that was a previous attempt to reduce the
	memory 
	cost. Even so the cost goes up with every new class and
	method added to Cocoa.framework; left unchecked, an identical app
	would take longer to launch and use more memory after every OS
	upgrade. 
      </p>
      <p>
	The obvious solution? Do the work of selector uniquing in the dyld
	shared cache. Build a selector table into the shared cache itself,
	and update the selector references in the cached copy of the
	shared libraries. Then you save memory because every process
	shares the same selector table, and save time because the runtime
	does not need to rebuild it during every app launch. The runtime
	only needs to fix the selector references from the app itself. The
	catch? 
	Selectors are too dynamic to be implemented as C symbols, so the
	shared cache construction tool needed to be taught how to read and
	write Objective-C's metadata. 
      </p>
      <h4>Optimization WIN</h4>
      <p>
	Snow Leopard's dyld shared cache uniques Objective-C selectors,
	and Snow Leopard's Objective-C runtime recognizes when the
	selectors in a shared library are already uniqued courtesy of the
	shared cache. About half of the runtime's initialization time is
	eliminated, making warm app launch several tenths of a second
	faster. Typical memory savings is 200-500 KB per process, 
	adding up to a few megabytes system-wide. When this optimization
	ships on the iPhone OS side, it's estimated to save 1 MB on a 128
	MB device. The iPhone performance team would pay any number of
	arms and legs for that kind of gain. 
      </p>
      <p>
	You can watch the system in action with various debugging flags.
      </p>
      <p>
      <code>$ sudo /usr/bin/update_dyld_shared_cache -debug -verify<br>
[...]<br>
update_dyld_shared_cache: for x86_64, uniquing objc selectors<br>

</code>
      </p>
      <p>
      <code>$ OBJC_PRINT_PREOPTIMIZATION=YES /usr/bin/defaults<br>
objc[424]: PREOPTIMIZATION: selector preoptimization ENABLED (version 3)<br>

objc[424]: PREOPTIMIZATION: honoring preoptimized selectors in /System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Versions/C/Foundation<br>
</code>
</p>
      <p>
	You can estimate the memory savings with the
	<code><a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/allmemory.1.html">allmemory</a></code> tool. Record post-launch memory usage of an
	app run with and without environment variable
	<code>OBJC_DISABLE_PREOPTIMIZATION=YES</code>. Look for the count
	of dirty pages; each dirty page is 4 KB eaten by that
	process. With 64-bit TextEdit I see the dirty page count jump from
	725 to 1069 after disabling the optimization. This is an
	overestimate - many of those pages would have been not-dirty in
	Leopard because of the old built-in selector table - but it does
	show the magnitude of the win.
      </p>
      <p>
	The Objective-C runtime does more than just selector uniquing
	during launch. Future improvements to the dyld shared cache may
	precompute some of that other work, to further improve launch
	time, save memory, and reduce the cost of linking to Objective-C
	code that you don't actually use. But selector uniquing as seen in
	Snow Leopard is by far the biggest bang for the buck.
