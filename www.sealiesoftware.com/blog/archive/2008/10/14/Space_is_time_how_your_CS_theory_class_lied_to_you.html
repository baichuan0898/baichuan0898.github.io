	In your computer science algorithms course, you learned about
	space-time tradeoffs. An algorithm that requires lots of time can
	often be changed to take less time but more space. A wide range of
	performance optimizations work this way, from caching to 
	memoization to loop unrolling.
      </p>
      <p>
	But the "tradeoff" is a lie. Space <i>is</i> time. 
      </p>
      <p>
	Every use of space incurs a time cost. In
	your theory class, the time cost of space is swept under the big-O
	rug. On 
	your big-iron machine running a single computational workload or
	CPU benchmark, the time cost of space is small compared to the
	other time costs involved. But in the real world of consumer-grade
	devices, with limited memory and power, the time cost of space is
	tremendous. A performance optimization that tries to trade less
	time for more space often ends up requiring more time and more
	space. 
      </p>
      <p>
	The <code>gcc</code> compiler uses a garbage collector to manage
	its memory. To save time, <code>gcc</code> does not even start to
	collect any garbage until its memory size is quite large. 
	"That's fine", you might say, "my new 
	machine has gigabytes of memory". But the kernel needs a
	big chunk of memory just to keep track of the rest of the
	memory. And you're running a web browser, and an email client, and
	an IDE, and music and chat and clock and search and sync and backup 
	and everything else you didn't have a decade or two ago. 
	And your build system runs multiple 
	<code>gcc</code> commands in parallel because your machine has
	multiple cores. Now your memory capacity isn't so big after all,
	the system starts paging to disk, and your compiler performance
	falls off a cliff and the web browser is sluggish 
	too. In this memory-constrained environment, trying to use less
	time (skipping GC) and more space (accumulating garbage) has
	backfired badly. 
      </p>
      <p>
	Space <i>is</i> time. An optimization that is faster on a
	well-endowed device may be much slower everywhere else. Assume
	your customer's machines have less memory than yours, and design
	and test accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
	At one modern extreme, the iPhone has only 128 MB of
	memory. Ever seen iPhone Safari "forget" a web page and
	re-download it after you switched tabs or apps? The system ran out
	of memory and Safari had to throw the page away. On the iPhone,
	your favorite space-time tradeoff in your own program may
	sacrifice the user's web page, requiring a repeat download across
	a slow network. Good for your program, perhaps, but bad for the
	user. 
      </p>
      <p>
	Space <i>is</i> time. An
	optimization that makes <i>your program</i> faster may
	make <i>the user's system</i> slower overall. Play well with others. 
      </p>
      <p>
	Most of Mac OS X is compiled with <code>-Os</code> instead of
	<code>-O3</code>, to reduce code size. Mac OS X's memory allocator
	is slower than other allocators under some workloads, because it
	tries to avoid hoarding unused memory where other processes can't
	use it. Mac OS X uses dynamic shared libraries exclusively, then
	combines multiple shared libraries into a single shared cache,
	then carefully re-processes that shared cache, all to save space
	across multiple processes. 
	Many ideas for faster cross-library calls or accelerated 
	Objective-C method dispatch or JIT-based optimization have been
	abandoned because they need too much space and do not save enough time.
      </p>
      <p>
	CPU-focused optimization can be just as evil as the infamous
	premature optimization. Space <i>is</i> time.
