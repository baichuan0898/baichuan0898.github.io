    <p class="post-meta">Feb 21, 2010 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">Resolving symlinks in a path is very easy in Cocoa (it can be done in a single statement) but aliases require more work. Additionally the commands for resolving symlinks and aliases are incompatible with each other &mdash; meaning that you can resolve a path containing symlinks or aliases but not a mixture of the two. In this post, I present a category on <code>NSString</code> that will allow you to resolve a path containing any combination of symlinks or aliases as simply as resolving symlinks alone.</div>

    <div class="content">The Core Data Programming Guide clearly states that Core Data is not a database but since both Core Data and a database are ways of providing searchable, persistent storage, exactly how and why they are different may not be clear. In this post, I'll look at the way Core Data works and the reasons why its features and capabilities are different to those of common SQL databases &mdash; even though an SQL database may be used as the backing store.</div>

    <div class="content">As fast as computers are, heavy use of floating point functions can still slow them down. One way around this, is to use a lookup table instead of calculating floating point values at runtime. But keeping a generated table up-to-date is annoying work. In this post, I'll show you how to create a lookup table automatically using a custom build rule, making an OpenGL animation 5 times faster in the process.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">Jan 25, 2010 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">Key-value coding (KVC) is a way of decoupling a generic action from the specific properties it may need to act upon. It is most commonly associated with the <code>NSKeyValueCoding</code> protocol but there are a number of other ways to achieve the same effect.

    <div class="content">In this post, I look at one of the stranger concepts in Objective-C &mdash; the meta-class. Every class in Objective-C has its own associated meta-class but since you rarely ever use a meta-class directly, they can remain enigmatic. I'll start by looking at how to create a class at runtime. By examining the "class pair" that this creates, I'll explain what the meta-class is and also cover the more general topic of what it means for data to be an object or a class in Objective-C.</div>
