			<span class="introduction"><p>The Foundation framework provides all the tools you need for inter-thread communication &mdash; without needing to handling locks and synchronization yourself. I'll show you Cocoa's tools for inter-thread communication, notifications and easy synchronization &mdash; including far simpler code for posting NSNotifications on the main thread than the Cocoa documentation suggests.</p></span>

<span class="fullpost">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Multi-threaded code has a reputation for being difficult to write and prone to deadlocks, race conditions and unpredictable behaviors.</p>

<p>While this remains true if you are forced to handle locking yourself, Foundation provides all the tools you require to manage typical multi-threaded situations so that you can avoid the risks of locks entirely.</p>

<p>This post comes from my shock at Apple's suggestion (in their <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Notifications/Articles/Threading.html">Delivering Notifications To Particular Threads</a>) that something as simple as sending an <code>NSNotification</code> from one thread to another should take dozens of lines of code and a dedicated class for the purpose.</p>

<p>It isn't that difficult. Sending data between threads (including notifications) is a one line job.</p>

<h2>Rules for safe simple threading</h2>

<p>Simple thread safety in Cocoa requires just two rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>Every variable or object must nominally belong to a thread (although may be completely handed over to a different thread) and must not be used in multiple threads without handover (unless it is on the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/ThreadSafetySummary/ThreadSafetySummary.html">list of explicity thread-safe classes</a>).</li>
<li>All communication between threads (after thread startup) should use <code>performSelector:onThread:withObject:waitUntilDone:</code> and both the receiver and the "object" should belong (or be handed over) to the target thread.</li>
</ol>

<p>The only limitation with this approach is that any thread that <em>receives</em> communication must be running an <code>NSRunLoop</code>. Since communication after construction is normally one-way (from worker thread back to the main thread) this is rarely a significant limitation. Other threads can invoke the <code>[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop]</code>'s <code>runMode:beforeDate</code> to process the run loop and receive messages.</p>

<p>A lot of multi-threaded code does not follow these rules. A lot of multi-threaded code uses a careful system of locks, synchronized sections, volatile variables and atomic operations to allow single objects to be accessed simultaneously from multiple threads. This does work but generally speaking: you don't want to design code this way. It's tricky, confusing and prone to errors. To illustrate, you can have a look at how many changes I had to make to my AudioStreamer code between the <a href="../../2008/09/streaming-and-playing-live-mp3-stream.html">first</a> and <a href="../06/revisiting-old-post-streaming-and.html">second</a> versions &mdash; rock-solid, manually-locked code is annoying and difficult to write.</p>

<p>Instead, as much as possible, you should write your code to keep all objects compartmentalized to individual threads and to restrict communication between threads to method invocations using <code>performSelector:onThread:withObject:waitUntilDone:</code>. To explain how this works, I'll show a simple example of something running in a separate thread and show how it can perform all its inter-thread communication using existing Foundation methods to automatically handle all thread safety issues.</p>

<h2>Scenario: writing to a network NSFileHandle in a worker thread</h2>

<p>One of the simplest situations where you may want multithreading is writing to a network socket's <code>NSFileHandle</code>. This is a synchronous operation (blocks until complete) so it is a good idea to perform this in a worker thread so that the main thread of your program can remain responsive.</p>

<p>The following class is an <code>NSOperation</code> subclass. If you don't know about <code>NSOperation</code>, it's an object that you can add to an <code>NSOperationQueue</code> to have the object's <code>main</code> method run in a separate thread (see <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/OperationObjects/OperationObjects.html">Apple's Threading Programming Guide</a>). While <code>NSThread</code>'s <code>detachNewThreadSelector:toTarget:withObject:</code> is the best way to launch a single worker thread, <code>NSOperation</code>s are the best way to run a series threaded tasks (or has been since <a href="http://www.mikeash.com/?page=pyblog/use-nsoperationqueue.html">serious bugs in it were fixed in 10.5.7</a>).</p>

<p>This class' init method takes an <code>NSFileHandle</code> and an <code>NSData</code> object on construction and writes the data to the file handle in its <code>main</code> method.</p>

<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">@end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>NSOperation</code> is created and its thread is launched as follows:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span class="c1">// Assume the operationQueue, fileHandle and fileData already exist
</span><span class="c1"></span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">operationQueue</span>
    <span class="nl">addOperation</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="p">[[[</span><span class="n">FileWriteOperation</span> <span class="n">alloc</span><span class="p">]</span>
            <span class="nl">initWithFileHandle</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">fileHandle</span>
            <span class="nl">data</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">fileData</span><span class="p">]</span>
        <span class="n">autorelease</span><span class="p">]];</span></code></pre></div>


<p>To follow the first rule of thread-safety, after the <code>FileWriteOperation</code> is constructed, the <code>fileHandle</code> value passed into its <code>initWithFileHandle:data:</code> method cannot be used again outside the <code>NSOperationQueue</code>'s worker thread.</p>

<h2>Communicating success or failure</h2>

<p>The above class works but doesn't have any way of communicating the result. What would be good is if we could send a <code>writeFinishedWithSuccess:YES</code> at the "<code>write has succeeded</code>" line and a <code>writeFinishedWithSuccess:NO</code> at the "<code>write has failed</code>" line.</p>

<p>The unsafe way of doing this is to invoke a method on another object sending the result:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc">    <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">responseHandler</span> <span class="nl">writeFinishedWithSuccess</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">YES</span><span class="p">];</span> <span class="o">//</span> <span class="n">BAD</span><span class="o">!!</span></code></pre></div>

<p>If <code>responseHandle</code> belongs to another thread, then this method could cause any number of race conditions and other multi-threading issues.</p>

<p>The solution though is exceptionally simple:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc">    <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">responseHandler</span>
        <span class="nl">performSelectorOnMainThread</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="k">@selector</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nl">writeFinishedWithSuccess</span><span class="p">:)</span>
        <span class="nl">withObject</span><span class="p">:[</span><span class="n">NSNumber</span> <span class="nl">numberWithBool</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">YES</span><span class="p">]</span>
        <span class="nl">waitUntilDone</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">NO</span><span class="p">];</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This assumes that <code>responseHandler</code> is a nominally "main thread" object. You can use the <code>performSelector:onThread:withObject:waitUntilDone:</code> method and specify a different thread if you need to send the response elsewhere.</p>

<p>You'll notice that the parameter has to be an object in this case (<code>[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES]</code> instead of simply <code>YES</code>) and any parameter that you pass to another thread should not be used again in the current thread.</p>

<h2>Delivering Notifications To Particular Threads</h2>

<p>Of course, the <code>FileWriteOperation</code> class shown above doesn't have a <code>responseHandle</code> object that it can notify when it is done, so I'd rather use an <code>NSNotification</code> sent to the <code>NSNotificationCenter</code> and if any object wants to receive the notification, it can.</p>

<p>The <code>NSNotificationCenter</code> itself is thread-safe but it delivers the notifications on the thread in which you invoke <code>postNotification:</code> so if you expect the observers of that notification to belong to a different thread, you've just broken those objects' thread safety.</p>

<p>Normally it is a good idea to deliver all notifications on the main thread. We can do this as follows:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span class="c1">// Line of code in some method of some class...
</span><span class="c1"></span><span class="p">[[</span><span class="nb">self</span> <span class="k">class</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="nl">performSelectorOnMainThread</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="k">@selector</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nl">postNotification</span><span class="p">:)</span>
    <span class="nl">withObject</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">NSNotification</span>
            <span class="nl">notificationWithName</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&#34;FileWriteOperationSucceeded&#34;</span>
            <span class="nl">object</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">]];</span>

<span class="p">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">postNotification:</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NSNotification</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">aNotification</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="p">[[</span><span class="n">NSNotificationCenter</span> <span class="n">defaultCenter</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="nl">postNofication</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">aNotification</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Notice that we don't call <code>+[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter]</code> until we're on the main thread. If we call it on the other thread, it will return the notification center for that other thread.</p>

<p>Some classes follow a different behavior of delivering notifications to the thread on which they were constructed (not necessarily the main thread). To follow this behavior, simply save the <code>[NSThread currentThread]</code> on construction and perform the <code>postNotification:</code> selector on that thread.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that the notification is passing "<code>self</code>" from one thread to another &mdash; breaking the thread ownership of "<code>self</code>". This is only really safe in one of the following cases:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Handover</strong> &mdash; the parameter will never be used on this thread again.<br/>In this case, if "<code>self</code>" is complete on the worker thread (for example at the bottom of the <code>main</code> method shown above). In this case, the object is passing itself back to the other thread.</li>
<li><strong>Thread-safe</strong> &mdash; if the class or specific methods are guaranteed to be thread-safe.<br/>In this case, if the only methods invoked on <code>self</code> are <code>retain</code>, <code>release</code> and the default pointer comparison <code>isEqual:</code> method (these are the methods invoked when removing from an <code>NSMutableArray</code>). These are guaranteed thread-safe methods.</li></ul>

<p>If neither of these are true then you can't pass <code>self</code> (or any other parameter) safely between threads.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The purpose of this article is to communicate two ideas:</p>

<ul><li>Carefully locking and synchronizing makes programming hard but if you design your objects to be used on only one thread at a time, then they are thread-safe without the need for locks or synchronzation (if needed, split your objects into components for separate threads).</li>
<li>Use inter-thread communication to keep objects in separate threads up-to-date with each other. In Cocoa, this is very simple but you do need to ensure that all parameters you pass are either thread-safe objects or handover objects.</li></ul>

<p>Apple's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Notifications/Articles/Threading.html">Delivering Notifications To Particular Threads</a> code is woefully out of date. I would be happy to see it completely changed &mdash; you should never need to implement something so complex just to deliver notifications to another thread.</p>

<p>Of couse, there are always situations where you can't run an <code>NSRunLoop</code> to process <code>performSelector:onThread:withObject:waitUntilDone:</code> messages. There are also situations where you feel that one of your object
s must be multi-threaded (rather than single thread exclusive). Either of these cases requires will require a synchronized or locked solution but my recommendation is to try to find an <code>NSRunLoop</code> and thread exclusive solution first as these are significantly easier to manage and prone to fewer potential problems.</p>
