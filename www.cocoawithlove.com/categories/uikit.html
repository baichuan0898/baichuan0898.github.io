    <div class="content">The purpose of this post is so that I will have a link to give people when they ask: how do I write an iOS application that pulls data from an RSS feed, displays it pretty and can put things on a map.

    <p class="post-meta">May 30, 2011 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">In this post I show two reusable classes for fetching data via HTTP: one that parses the result as XML and another that parses as JSON. These are relatively simple tasks but due to the number of required steps, they can become tiresome if you don't have robust, reusable code for the task. These classes will work on iOS or on the Mac but the optional error alerts and password dialogs are only implemented for iOS.</div>

    <div class="content">After initially starting with a small set of fairly basic media APIs in iPhone OS 2.0, the APIs and the features they provide have dramatically increased in the past 2 years and provided a rapidly moving target for developers trying to remain current. In this post, I'll try to summarize all of the different APIs in iOS 4.3 for playing media, when they arrived, what their purposes are, what their limitations are and what it's been like to remain up-to-date and support new features.</div>

    <div class="content">In this post, I'll show you the current classes I use to construct and manage UITableViews in a number of different projects. This code is an amalgamation and evolution of some ideas that I've presented in a few earlier posts including my posts on heterogenous cells in a table view and easy custom table view drawing. But this implementation also chooses to do some things differently in an effort to continuously simplify the task of creating customized tables and views in iOS.</div>

    <div class="content">I was recently asked by a reader if I used any modelling program to model the classes and relationships in my Mac applications. The answer is no, I don't model the application side of my programs. The reason for this is not because applications are always small and simple. The reason is that all applications have approximately the same design &mdash; eventually everything in a well-designed application becomes intuitive.</div>

    <div class="content">Bindings are one of the best ways of connecting your view and model on the Mac but due to the layers of abstraction involved &mdash; and the fact that they don't exist on other platforms &mdash; bindings can seem foreign and confusing.

    <div class="content">You don't have to look far to find people suggesting that constructing views in code will increase the speed of your program.

    <p class="post-meta">Dec 8, 2009 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">In this post, I'll discuss iPhone program design using the example of a small but non-trivial iPhone application to provide examples of how the design is implemented. The design includes: how to manage data coming from different sources, how to manage multiple views of that data and how to design your program so it remains simple and manageable as it grows. In short, I'll be discussing how Model-View-Controller (MVC) applies to an iPhone application but I'll also discuss how even simple programs are considerably more hierarchic through their controllers and branched through their models and views than the basic description "Model-View-Controller" might imply.</div>

    <div class="content">The Info.plist file is home to the metadata about your application used by the operating system. Most Cocoa programmers know that it stores the bundle identifier, icon name and version number of an application but the Info.plist can also control access to essential iPhone hardware resources and can change the very nature of your Mac OS X applications. In this post, I'll cover basic Info.plist usage and also explain some of the rarer settings.</div>
