    <p class="post-meta">May 30, 2011 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">In this post I show two reusable classes for fetching data via HTTP: one that parses the result as XML and another that parses as JSON. These are relatively simple tasks but due to the number of required steps, they can become tiresome if you don't have robust, reusable code for the task. These classes will work on iOS or on the Mac but the optional error alerts and password dialogs are only implemented for iOS.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">Oct 6, 2010 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">In this post, I look at an approach for testing if an arbitrary pointer is a pointer to a valid Objective-C object. The result from the test is not absolutely accurate and can interfere with gdb debugging if the pointer isn't a valid memory location, so this is not something you'd want to do often (and certainly not in production code). But it can be a handy debugging tool for when you're staring blindly at memory you didn't allocate.</div>

    <div class="content">In this post, I build and run a Cocoa Mac application on the command-line. This might not sound like a very difficult goal but I'll attempt to follow an additional constraint: use as few tools, components, classes and even lines of code as possible; truly minimalist Cocoa programming. The goal is to create an application that qualifies as a proper Mac application (including a menubar and a window) but without using Xcode, without an Info.plist file, without NIB files, without Interface Builder and without even using a text editor other than the Terminal itself.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">Feb 21, 2010 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">Resolving symlinks in a path is very easy in Cocoa (it can be done in a single statement) but aliases require more work. Additionally the commands for resolving symlinks and aliases are incompatible with each other &mdash; meaning that you can resolve a path containing symlinks or aliases but not a mixture of the two. In this post, I present a category on <code>NSString</code> that will allow you to resolve a path containing any combination of symlinks or aliases as simply as resolving symlinks alone.</div>

    <div class="content">In this post, I look at one of the stranger concepts in Objective-C &mdash; the meta-class. Every class in Objective-C has its own associated meta-class but since you rarely ever use a meta-class directly, they can remain enigmatic. I'll start by looking at how to create a class at runtime. By examining the "class pair" that this creates, I'll explain what the meta-class is and also cover the more general topic of what it means for data to be an object or a class in Objective-C.</div>

    <div class="content">As pointed out by Mike Ash in his recent Friday Q&A 2009-11-13: Dangerous Cocoa Calls, <code>NSHost</code> is not thread-safe for use outside of the main thread and due to potentially slow, synchronous network access is not really suitable for use on the main thread either. Fortunately, in Cocoa there are often ways to transparently fix classes that don't work as they should. In this post, I'll show you how you can transparently patch <code>NSHost</code> using a drop-in solution and provide a non-blocking solution for <code>NSHost</code> lookups.</div>

    <div class="content">This post is a look at how clang implements blocks and how this implementation leads to a number of strange behaviors including local variables that end up global, Objective-C objects allocated on the stack instead of the heap, C variables that behave like C++ references, Objective-C objects in non-Objective-C languages, copy methods that don't copy and retain methods that don't retain.</div>

    <div class="content">There is no single-line method for converting between formatting date strings and date objects in Cocoa &mdash; the API opts for flexibility rather than simplicity.
