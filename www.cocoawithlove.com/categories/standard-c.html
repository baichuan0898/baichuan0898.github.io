    <p class="post-meta">Sep 20, 2010 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">In this post, I build and run a Cocoa Mac application on the command-line. This might not sound like a very difficult goal but I'll attempt to follow an additional constraint: use as few tools, components, classes and even lines of code as possible; truly minimalist Cocoa programming. The goal is to create an application that qualifies as a proper Mac application (including a menubar and a window) but without using Xcode, without an Info.plist file, without NIB files, without Interface Builder and without even using a text editor other than the Terminal itself.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">Aug 30, 2010 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">In this post, I'll show you how you can create objects without using the standard instance allocation process (either <code>+[NSObject alloc]</code> or <code>class_createInstance()</code>). I'll also explain why you might do this &mdash; the benefits and drawbacks to a custom object creation process.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">May 12, 2010 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">In this post, I'll take a high-level look at how malloc is implemented on the Mac. I'll look at how memory is allocated for "tiny", "small" and "large" allocation scales, the multi-core performance improvements introduced in Snow Leopard and some inbuilt debugging features you can trigger for finding memory problems including buffer overruns.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">Feb 21, 2010 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">Resolving symlinks in a path is very easy in Cocoa (it can be done in a single statement) but aliases require more work. Additionally the commands for resolving symlinks and aliases are incompatible with each other &mdash; meaning that you can resolve a path containing symlinks or aliases but not a mixture of the two. In this post, I present a category on <code>NSString</code> that will allow you to resolve a path containing any combination of symlinks or aliases as simply as resolving symlinks alone.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">Feb 8, 2010 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">As fast as computers are, heavy use of floating point functions can still slow them down. One way around this, is to use a lookup table instead of calculating floating point values at runtime. But keeping a generated table up-to-date is annoying work. In this post, I'll show you how to create a lookup table automatically using a custom build rule, making an OpenGL animation 5 times faster in the process.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">Oct 18, 2009 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">This post is a look at how clang implements blocks and how this implementation leads to a number of strange behaviors including local variables that end up global, Objective-C objects allocated on the stack instead of the heap, C variables that behave like C++ references, Objective-C objects in non-Objective-C languages, copy methods that don't copy and retain methods that don't retain.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">Oct 12, 2009 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">Objective-C remains an impediment for many programmers coming to the Mac or iPhone platforms &mdash; few programmers have ever experienced it before learning Cocoa, forcing two learning curves at once for new Cocoa developers. How did Apple end up with such a weird language? And for a company known to replace CPU architectures and their entire operating system, why does Apple persist with Objective-C? The answer lies in the methods.</div>

    <div class="content">Blocks are a welcome addition to C/Objective-C/C++/Objective-C++ with Snow Leopard but they carry with them the worst aspect of Standard C: function pointer declaration and casting syntax.

    <p class="post-meta">Sep 16, 2009 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">It is very easy, when developing on a new operating system, to create projects that won't run on any previous OS version. To ensure backwards compatibility, there are Xcode and gcc options that allow you to build while maintaining support for earlier OS versions. In this post, I'll look at the ways in which this compatibility is controlled and some of the new ways it can go wrong on Snow Leopard.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">Jul 23, 2009 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">If you need to use temporary files in your application and you search the Cocoa documentation for "temporary file", you're unlikely to find anything that explains how to create one. Since temporary files and folders are subject to a number of security issues and race conditions when done wrong, it is important to know the correct way to create them. I'll show you some code that you can copy and paste into your applications to create temporary files and folders safely.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">Jun 10, 2009 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">Compared to other languages, method names in Objective-C are weird. They're long, they're wordy, they include names for the parameters and they seem to repeat information you can get elsewhere. Despite these apparent negatives, Objective-C method naming can save you time and effort. I'll show you how methods are named so that you can predict them without documentation and understand how methods work and how they use their parameters from their names alone.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">Jun 3, 2009 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">On Unix platforms, a common approach for Base64 encoding is to use libcrypto (the OpenSSL library). However, like most C libraries, you need to wrap it to integrate with Objective-C data types (like NSData and NSString) and it isn't available on the iPhone. I'll show you how to handle base64 encoding/decoding with OpenSSL and without so you can handle the Mac and iPhone equally.</div>

    <div class="content">This week I'll talk about methods that take variable numbers of arguments, also known as variadic methods. I'll show you the Objective-C syntax and implementation, give a quick rundown of the ways that Cocoa classes provide variable argument support and I'll also show you a way to fake va_list parameters to handle Cocoa's variadic method equivalents at runtime.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">Oct 31, 2008 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">NSXMLDocument is the normal tree-based XML parser in Cocoa. But if you're writing for the iPhone, this class isn't available.

    <p class="post-meta">Aug 2, 2008 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">Each of the major C variants on the Mac implement character strings in their own way. It is fairly easy to learn the syntax differences between them but a simple API Reference doesn't explain the reasons for implementations: the different philosophies behind the implementations. In this post, I'll go past the 'How' of string differences and instead explain the 'Why' of differences between the three string implementations.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">Apr 14, 2008 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">A very common C technique for reinterpreting data types has the potential to cause nasty bugs.
