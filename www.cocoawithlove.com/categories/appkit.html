    <p class="post-meta">May 30, 2011 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">In this post I show two reusable classes for fetching data via HTTP: one that parses the result as XML and another that parses as JSON. These are relatively simple tasks but due to the number of required steps, they can become tiresome if you don't have robust, reusable code for the task. These classes will work on iOS or on the Mac but the optional error alerts and password dialogs are only implemented for iOS.</div>

    <div class="content">In this post, I'll look at best practice for using and managing text strings in your user interface. This is a fairly simple topic but Cocoa has established "best practices" for handling user interface strings that new Cocoa developers should be aware of. Since it is inevitably related, I'll also look at the steps involved in localizing the strings in your applications but remember: you should follow good practice for string handling, even if you have no intention of ever translating your application.</div>

    <div class="content">In this post, I build and run a Cocoa Mac application on the command-line. This might not sound like a very difficult goal but I'll attempt to follow an additional constraint: use as few tools, components, classes and even lines of code as possible; truly minimalist Cocoa programming.

    <div class="content">I was recently asked by a reader if I used any modelling program to model the classes and relationships in my Mac applications.

    <div class="content">Many Mac OS X applications animate their regular application windows to fullscreen but since there's no dedicated method for the task, there's no standard Apple documentation that covers the operation. If you look for examples on the web, you'll find numerous examples that perform this operation using old APIs or methods intended for permanently fullscreen games (the wrong approach for an application window). In this post I'll show you my preferred approach for making an application window fullscreen, with continuous display and smooth animation.</div>

    <div class="content">In this post I will recreate code that is normally concealed between the <code>NSApplicationMain</code> call (invoked in a Cocoa application's <code>main</code> function) and the <code>sendEvent:</code> method (which distributes the events to windows and views from the main run loop). By recreating this code for you, I hope to explain the steps that occur between program startup and the dispatch of events to your code &mdash; so you can gain greater understanding of what <code>NSApplication</code> does on your behalf.</div>

    <div class="content">Recently, I searched for a world time converter &mdash; one that would handle future dates as well as the current time. There are web versions but I didn't find a genuine Mac OS X application that matched my desires. How hard could it be?
