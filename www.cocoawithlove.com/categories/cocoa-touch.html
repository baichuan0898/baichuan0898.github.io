    <p class="post-meta">May 30, 2011 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">In this post I show two reusable classes for fetching data via HTTP: one that parses the result as XML and another that parses as JSON. These are relatively simple tasks but due to the number of required steps, they can become tiresome if you don't have robust, reusable code for the task. These classes will work on iOS or on the Mac but the optional error alerts and password dialogs are only implemented for iOS.</div>

    <div class="content">Background audio in iOS is supposed to be as simple as entering a setting in your Info.plist and making sure your <code>kAudioSessionProperty_AudioCategory</code> is appropriate.

    <div class="content">In this post, I'll look at best practice for using and managing text strings in your user interface. This is a fairly simple topic but Cocoa has established "best practices" for handling user interface strings that new Cocoa developers should be aware of. Since it is inevitably related, I'll also look at the steps involved in localizing the strings in your applications but remember: you should follow good practice for string handling, even if you have no intention of ever translating your application.</div>

    <div class="content">As fast as computers are, heavy use of floating point functions can still slow them down. One way around this, is to use a lookup table instead of calculating floating point values at runtime. But keeping a generated table up-to-date is annoying work.

The design includes: how to manage data coming from different sources, how to manage multiple views of that data and how to design your program so it remains simple and manageable as it grows. In short, I'll be discussing how Model-View-Controller (MVC) applies to an iPhone application but I'll also discuss how even simple programs are considerably more hierarchic through their controllers and branched through their models and views than the basic description "Model-View-Controller" might imply.</div>

    <div class="content">There is no single-line method for converting between formatting date strings and date objects in Cocoa &mdash; the API opts for flexibility rather than simplicity.

    <div class="content">By default, UITableView only supports single-row selection. In this post, I'll show you how to implement multi-row selection, similar to the message edit interface in Mail.</div>

    <div class="content">This post looks at writing a UITableViewController for a table view that contains behaviorally unrelated rows &mdash; a common occurrence on the iPhone for tables containing multiple groups. I will present a simple alternative to Apple's UITableViewController template code that will reduce complexity and code as well as refocus areas-of-concern for this heterogeneous arrangement.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">Nov 23, 2008 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">Automated testing of application user interfaces can be tricky since user interfaces are designed for use by humans not automated tools. The iPhone is particularly challenging since existing tools that aid user interface testing on the Mac are not available. This post will show you a way to run automated, scripted tests on an iPhone app's user interface.</div>

    <div class="content">NSXMLDocument is the normal tree-based XML parser in Cocoa. But if you're writing for the iPhone, this class isn't available. Even on the Mac, sometimes you want tree-based parsing without the full overhead of NSXMLDocument. Here's how to use libxml2 to perform tree-based parsing in a Cocoa-friendly way.</div>
