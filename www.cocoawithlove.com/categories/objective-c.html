    <div class="content">We generally assume that we can send any message we want to a variable in our code typed as "<code>id</code>" and Objective-C's dynamic message handling will make the invocation work correctly at runtime. In some rare cases, this assumption is wrong. I'll look at situations where you need to be careful about sending messages to "<code>id</code>" typed variables and a situation where a limitation in the Objective-C language requires a hideous workaround to avoid serious bugs.</div>

    <div class="content">In this post, I build and run a Cocoa Mac application on the command-line. This might not sound like a very difficult goal but I'll attempt to follow an additional constraint: use as few tools, components, classes and even lines of code as possible; truly minimalist Cocoa programming.

    <div class="content">Recent articles by Jesper have re-ignited some discussion about whether Apple might be working on another programming language to replace Objective-C.

    <p class="post-meta">Mar 22, 2010 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">In the "modern" Objective-C runtime (that's iPhone OS or 64-bit Mac OS X), you can dynamically add ivars (instance variables) to a class without declaring them first. This allows a solution to the common "fragile base class" problem involving ivar layouts. Dynamic ivars can also help data hiding and abstraction and can even create a confusing situation where a base class and a sub class have ivars with the same names that don't refer to the same underlying data.</div>

    <div class="content">Bindings are one of the best ways of connecting your view and model on the Mac but due to the layers of abstraction involved &mdash; and the fact that they don't exist on other platforms &mdash; bindings can seem foreign and confusing.

    <div class="content">In this post, I look at one of the stranger concepts in Objective-C &mdash; the meta-class. Every class in Objective-C has its own associated meta-class but since you rarely ever use a meta-class directly, they can remain enigmatic. I'll start by looking at how to create a class at runtime. By examining the "class pair" that this creates, I'll explain what the meta-class is and also cover the more general topic of what it means for data to be an object or a class in Objective-C.</div>

    <div class="content">This post is about getting extra information from your program at runtime. Xcode and gdb both support a wide range of information access tools &mdash; but you need to know that they're there. Here are some Objective-C specific gdb tips and commands that all Cocoa programmers should know.</div>

    <p class="post-meta">Aug 16, 2008 (an Objective-C era article)</p>
    <div class="content">Of all the new features in Objective-C 2.0, none were as controversial as declared properties. Judging from the attacks, much of the controversy stems from a misunderstanding about the role that properties occupy in a class. In this post, I'll explain why properties are useful in Objective-C &mdash; and it isn't auto-generated getters and setters or the dot syntax.</div>

    <div class="content">Each of the major C variants on the Mac implement character strings in their own way. It is fairly easy to learn the syntax differences between them but a simple API Reference doesn't explain the reasons for implementations: the different philosophies behind the implementations. In this post, I'll go past the 'How' of string differences and instead explain the 'Why' of differences between the three string implementations.</div>

    <div class="content">The Categories feature of Objective-C lets the programmer add extra sets of methods after compilation, something impossible in most compiled languages. Using this feature, here is an Objective-C variant of the classic "Adapter" design pattern that allows two classes to work closely together, without two-way coupling dependency problems.</div>
