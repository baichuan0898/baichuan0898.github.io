			<span class="introduction"><p>A method named <span class="monospace">viewWillDraw</span> appeared in <span class="monospace">NSView</span> in Mac OS X 10.5. If you have cause to use it, this method replaces 6 other methods from earlier versions of Mac OS X. Read more to find out if you should use it and how it helps.</p></span>

<span class="fullpost">

<h2>Drawing in NSView</h2>
<p>Drawing in Cocoa happens in the <span class="monospace">NSView</span> method <span class="monospace">drawRect:</span>. Almost all programs perform some form of custom drawing, so this is one of the most commonly overridden methods in Cocoa.</p>

<p>The general procedure to follow in this method is:</p>
<ul><li>Determine what needs to be drawn</li>
<li>For each component that needs to be drawn, draw the component</li></ul>

<p>But what happens if, in the course of determining what needs to be drawn, you need to alter the area being updated? If, after determining what needs to be drawn, we realize that a different region needs to be updated, it's too late &mdash; the drawing rectangle can't be changed from inside <span class="monospace">drawRect:</span>.</p>

<h2>Layout code</h2>

<p>The above described problem is exactly what is faced by deferred or pending layout code.</p>

<p>Layout code deferred until <span class="monospace">drawInRect:</span> is unable to change the bounds for drawing and must a separate <span class="monospace">drawRect:</span> invocation. This can create pauses in display, tearing or other drawing problems.</p>

<p>Let me be clear here: when I say "layout", I don't mean the arrangement of <span class="monospace">NSView</span>s in a window (these will handle themselves). "Layout" in this sense means graphical objects within a single view which may need to be arranged in some way (i.e. column alignment, animation or other procedural generation or positioning).

<p>Deferred layout isn't very common (since drawing is normally triggered after layout is performed) but there may be cases where drawing begins while layout updates are still pending and you want to block the current <span class="monospace">drawRect:</span> invocation until the layout update is complete. If those layout updates alter the bounds of objects being drawn, we'll want the current invocation of <span class="monospace">-[NSView drawRect:]</span> to update those bounds, to avoid drawing glitches.</p>

<h2>The old solution</h2>

<p>The solution to this problem is to perform the layout required for drawing slightly earlier than <span class="monospace">drawRect:</span> &mdash; before the <span class="monospace">NSView</span> is locked into drawing a fixed rectangle. This gets around the limitation that <span class="monospace">drawRect:</span> can only update the area it is given.</p>

<p>Previously, this meant performing pending layout in these <span class="monospace">NSView</span> methods:</p>

<span class="monospace"><ul>
<li>displayIfNeeded</li>
<li>displayIfNeededIgnoringOpacity</li>
<li>_recursiveDisplayAllDirtyWithLockFocus:visRect:</li>
<li>_recursiveDisplayRectIfNeededIgnoringOpacity:isVisibleRect:rectIsVisibleRectForView:topView:</li>
<li>_recursiveDisplayRectIfNeededIgnoringOpacity:inContext:topView:</li>
<li>_lightWeightRecursiveDisplayInRect</li></ul></span>

<p>These are all the immediate predecessor methods to <span class="monospace">drawRect:</span>. When these methods are invoked, it is early enough to extend the drawing region by invoking <span class="monospace">setNeedsDisplayInRect:</span> and the new drawing region will get included when <span class="monospace">drawRect:</span> is invoked.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, only the first two other these methods are documented. The remainder are undocumented and Apple is free to change them without notice &mdash; potentially messing up your program. So "the old solution" was not a good solution.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: the Leopard solution</h2>

<p>Fortunately, Mac OS X 10.5 gives a much cleaner function to override before <span class="monospace">drawRect:</span> is invoked &mdash <span class="monospace">viewWillDraw</span>. This method is the perfect spot to perform deferred or pending layout. You can alter the bounds that need to be updated and this new altered region will be included on the very next update. This means no tearing and no holes in your drawing.</p>
