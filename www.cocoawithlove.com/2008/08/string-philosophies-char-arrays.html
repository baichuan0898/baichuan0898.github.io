It is fairly easy to learn the syntax differences between them but a simple API Reference doesn't explain the reasons for implementations: the different philosophies behind the implementations. In this post, I'll go past the 'How' of string differences and instead explain the 'Why' of differences between the three string implementations.</p></span>

<span class="fullpost">

<h2>The differences</h2>

<p>In C, <span class="monospace">char *</span> is just a pointer and requires that you access each character in turn to make any sense of the string. The C Standard Library provides a few functions but very little beyond basic array manipulation.</p>

<p>In C++, <span class="monospace">std::string</span> is more type-safe, offers bounds checking, plays nicely with input and output streams and provides traversal and extraction functions but otherwise expects that you'll access each character individually, in much the same way as you would for <span class="monospace">char *</span>.</p>

<p><span class="monospace">NSString</span> lives apart from its C-derived bretheren. You may never need to access its characters individually &mdash; in fact, direct access to the enclosed storage is forbidden. It is loaded with various processing functions. It also understands its own encoding and can convert itself to others.</p>

<h2>Underlying binary representations</h2>

<h3>Standard C's char arrays</h3>

<p>A Standard C string (normally typed as a <span class="monospace">char *</span>, or <span class="monospace">char[]</span>) is a series of 8-bit bytes of binary data, starting at an arbitrary memory address and proceeding until a zero byte (<span class="monospace">'\0'</span>) is encountered. You can set a <span class="monospace">char *</span> to any address in memory and begin treating memory from that point as a string. </p>

<p>If the string is an ASCII string, the highest bit in every byte will be zero, for other representations, there's no guarantee. String length is always a byte-length calculation (that doesn't include the <span class="monospace">'\0'</span> valued terminating byte), so for any variable length character representations (UTF-8), the length and the number of characters are not guaranteed to be the same thing.</p>

<h3>C++'s std::string</h3>

<p>The philosophy of C++ is to provide a "limited overhead" addition of object-orientation to Standard C. Following this philosophy, the content of <span class="monospace">std::string</span> in C++ is binary identical to a <span class="monospace">char[]</span>. There's normally a capacity, length and possibly vtable value in there but otherwise it's pretty much a Standard C string.</p>

<p>C++ also provides <span class="monospace">std::wstring</span> which is 16-bits per character (instead of <span class="monospace">std::string</span>'s 8-bits) but is otherwise fairly similar. But despite handling wide characters, <span class="monospace">std::wstring</span> is still unaware of its encoding, making any encoding conversion, including conversion to <span class="monospace">std::string</span> entirely the programmer's responsibility.</p>

<h3>Objective-C's NSString</h3>

<p>Objective-C's <span class="monospace">NSString</span> (technically, Foundation's but the distinction is blurred in Cocoa) is nothing like the other two. Following the philosophy of a class-cluster, <span class="monospace">NSString</span> offers no guarantees about how it is represented internally since it may transparently substitute a content-optimised subclass for <span class="monospace">NSString</span> on construction, choosing to represent its internals in whatever way is most appropriate for the data. Internally, an <span class="monospace">NSString</span> could be 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit values; it could be stored contiguously or in a heap structure for mutability; although most of the time, it's a contiguous block of 16-bit values.</p>

<p>Accessors to <span class="monospace">NSString</span>'s characters return <span class="monospace">unichar</span> (16-bit values values), so generally you treat <span class="monospace">NSString</span> as though it is a contiguous block of <span class="monospace">unichar</span> values, even though it may not technically be true. Since a few UTF-16 characters actually span multiple <span class="monospace">unichar</span> the number of fully decoded character sequences is not guaranteed to be the same as the string's <span class="monospace">length</span> but in non-Latin scripts, the length will generally be closer than either <span class="monospace">char *</span> or <span class="monospace">std::string</span> would be.</p>

<p><span class="monospace">NSString</span> is encoding aware, meaning that it knows how to convert itself correctly to other encodings. This can be a little annoying for programmers not used to specifying their encodings but makes <span class="monospace">NSString</span> easily adaptable for display and processing of any language.</p>

<h2>Aggregate versus iterative processing</h2>

<p>Both C and C++, promote the philosophies of sequential access. If you need to transform or process the a string, you're expected to access each character yourself and perform the work needed.</p>

<p>For example, converting a string to uppercase takes one of the following forms:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">length</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">strlen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">myString</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">myString</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">toupper</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">myString</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>or</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span></span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">transform</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">myString</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">begin</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="n">myString</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">end</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="n">myString</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">begin</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">toupper</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Since <span class="monospace">NSString</span> limits access to its internals, it must provide most function done character by character in C or C++ at the string level. This means that <span class="monospace">NSString</span> must provide vastly more functions to cover your likely needs but it also makes common tasks really easy:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objc" data-lang="objc"><span></span><span class="n">myString</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">myString</span> <span class="n">uppercase</span><span class="p">];</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>It also has the advantage that these operations can be multi-character sequence aware, unlike the character operators in C and C++ which only act on single characters.</p>

<p>Objective-C's philosophy of aggregate processing goes further than this. <span class="monospace">NSString</span> methods such as <span class="monospace">pathComponents</span> and <span class="monospace">componentsSeparatedByString:</span> provide the means to extract multiple objects in one pass &mdash; something that C and C++ never do in their standard libraries. Methods like <span class="monospace">rangeOfCharacterFromSet:</span> allow aggregate testing &mdash; testing multiple characters against the string in a single instruction.</p>

<p>A final aspect of <span class="monospace">NSString</span>'s design philosophy is that it is intended to be used as a class in a modern operating system. This is shown through the method <span class="monospace">stringByResolvingSymlinksInPath</span>. This task, while common on Unix derived operating systems, would be pointless in many of the environments in which pure C runs. It also shows <span class="monospace">NSString</span>'s willingness to adapt itself towards one of its common uses, something which the C++ Standard Libraries avoid.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>C is often described as the programming language which most closely models a general abstract CPU. It is tiny and light, providing the programmer with little more than basic arithmetic, memory access and input/ouput primitives to do their work. C's small size has allowed it to be ported to practically every CPU and environment in existence. Its closeness to an abstracted CPU also means that, if used correctly, it is as fast and optimal as a compiled language can be.</p>

<p>C++ adds a whole host of object paradigms and an extended standard library to the underlying syntax of C. Where possible, C++ tries to be a "zero cost" addition to C. In reality, this amounts to "limited overhead" but with understanding, C++ still allows precise C-level control. The C++ libraries focus on templating, with the premise that the choice of template variable should determine the scope, not the available methods.</p> 

<p>From a compiler perspective, Objective-C is more C-like than C++. Philosophically speaking though, it's truly the odd one out. It provides proper unicode string handling. It provides large amounts of processing options, outputs arrays and provides specialized methods for the most common tasks. It doesn't reveal details about how it is stored internally but uses this to provide significant optimizations solutions where possible.</p>
